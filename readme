This beta version code has been provided to help advance research on absorption band effects. We anticipate that future optimization of the code will lead to a useful and robust tool for predicting the absorption line height (alh) of chlorophyll a using particulate beam-attenuation (cp) spectra. Planned improvements include refining the eigenvector spectra, improving the fitting step that calculates the cp residuals, and updating the model coefficients. Some of these improvements will require consideration of a greater variety of cp datasets.
The code provided here was modeled using a subsampled portion of cp derived using a WetLabs ac-s during the Tara Oceans Expedition, and has not been evaluated on additional datasets.
Citation of the Applied Optics manuscript for which this code was produced would be greatly appreciated, as is feedback regarding suggested improvements or documenting the performance of this code with another relevant dataset.
